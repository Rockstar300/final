            <p>Betta fish have a special organ called the labyrinth that allows them to breathe oxygen directly from the air, which means they can survive in low-oxygen environments, unlike many other fish.</p>

            <p>When a Betta fish flares its gills, it is showing aggression or displaying dominance. This behavior is often seen when a male Betta sees another male or its own reflection.</p>

        <h2>Care Requirements</h2>
        <p>- Tank Size: A Betta fish needs at least a 5-gallon tank. A larger tank provides more swimming space and helps maintain water quality.</p>
        <p>- Water Conditions: Bettas prefer warm water (around 75-80°F or 24-27°C) and can be sensitive to water quality. A gentle filter is recommended since strong currents can stress them out.</p>
        <p>- Diet: Betta fish are carnivores and should be fed a varied diet, including high-quality Betta pellets or frozen/live foods like bloodworms or brine shrimp.</p>
        <p>- Water Changes: Regular water changes (at least 25-30% weekly) are essential to keep the water clean and free from toxins.</p>

          <h1>Fun Fact!</h1> 
          <p>Betta fish can be bred, but breeding them requires specific knowledge and setup. Males build bubble nests, and the female is introduced to the male when the nest is ready. The male cares for the eggs and fry until they are old enough to swim on their own.</p>

        <h3>Physical Features</h3>
        <p>- Colors:  Betta fish come in a variety of colors, including red, blue, purple, green, white, and black. Some even have iridescent shades that change in the light.</p>
        <p>- Fins: One of the most striking features of Betta fish is their long, flowing fins, especially in males. Some Bettas have "crown" or "plakat" fins, which give them different shapes.</p>
        <p>- Size: Bettas are typically small, usually reaching about 2.5 inches (6-7 cm) in length.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Personality & Behavior</h3>
        <p>-  Territorial: Male Betta fish are highly territorial and should not be housed together. They will fight to the death if kept in close proximity.</p>
        <p>- Aggressive: Betta males often display aggressive behavior, especially when they see their reflection or other males. However, they can be kept with other species that are non-aggressive and do not have long, flowing fins.</p>
        <p>- Solitary: Betta fish do well on their own, but they can also live with peaceful fish like snails or certain types of shrimp, provided there is enough space.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Common Health Issues</h3>        
        <p>- Fin Rot: Caused by poor water conditions or bacterial infection, fin rot can cause the fins to deteriorate. Regular water changes and proper water quality help prevent this.</p>
        <p>- Ich (White Spot Disease): This is a common parasitic infection that causes white spots on the fish’s body. It can be treated with medication and elevated water temperature.</p>
        <p>- Velvet Disease: A parasitic infection that causes a gold or rust-colored coating on the fish’s skin. Like Ich, it can be treated with medications.</p>
